# Getting PSQL to work with Python  
  
1. Update yum: `sudo yum update`, and enter yes to all prompts    
2. Upgrade pip: `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --upgrade pip`  
3. Get psycopg2: `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install psycopg2-binary`    
4. Get SQLAlchemy: `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1`    
  
# Setting up PSQL  
  
1. Install PostGreSQL: `sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel postgresql-contrib postgresql-docs`    
    Enter yes to all prompts.    
2. Initialize PSQL database: `sudo service postgresql initdb`    
3. Start PSQL: `sudo service postgresql start`    
4. Make a new superuser: `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER`    
    If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked!  
5. Make a new database: `sudo -u postgres createdb $USER`    
        If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked!  
6. Make sure your user shows up:    
    a) `psql`    
    b) `\du` look for ec2-user as a user    
    c) `\l` look for ec2-user as a database    
7. Make a new user:    
    a) `psql` (if you already quit out of psql)    
    ## REPLACE THE [VALUES] IN THIS COMMAND! Type this with a new (short) unique password.   
    b) I recommend 4-5 characters - it doesn't have to be very secure. Remember this password!  
        `create user [some_username_here] superuser password '[some_unique_new_password_here]';`    
    c) `\q` to quit out of sql    
8. `cd` into `lect11` and make a new file called `sql.env` and add `SQL_USER=` and `SQL_PASSWORD=` in it  
9. Fill in those values with the values you put in 7. b)  
  
  
# Enabling read/write from SQLAlchemy  
There's a special file that you need to enable your db admin password to work for:  
1. Open the file in vim: `sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql9/data/pg_hba.conf`
If that doesn't work: `sudo vim $(psql -c "show hba_file;" | grep pg_hba.conf)`  
2. Replace all values of `ident` with `md5` in Vim: `:%s/ident/md5/g`  
3. After changing those lines, run `sudo service postgresql restart`  
4. Ensure that `sql.env` has the username/password of the superuser you created!  
5. Run your code!    
  a) `npm run watch`. If prompted to install webpack-cli, type "yes"    
  b) In a new terminal, `python app.py`    
  c) Preview Running Application (might have to clear your cache by doing a hard refresh)
